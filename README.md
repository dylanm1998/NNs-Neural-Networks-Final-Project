# Greenhouse environment and electricity prediction based on the TCN (Temporal Convolutional Networks) model

Goal: 
Utilize the TCN model to predict the environment and electricity in the greenhouse based on the greenhouse dataset
Data Collectionï¼š
Collect greenhouse data (environmental data and electricity consumed by equipment) for one year
To run the code
Step 1
Download the greenhouse dataset from final_project_data.csv
Step 2
The prediction model is obtained by running
