## ‚ö†Ô∏è Kind Reminder

> **Caution:** TensorFlow 2.10 was the last release that supported GPU on native Windows.  
> Starting with TensorFlow 2.11, to run TensorFlow with GPU support, you must either use **WSL2** or install `tensorflow`/`tensorflow-cpu` with optional [TensorFlow-DirectML-Plugin](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip).

## üíª Running Environment Guide

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Linux System (Recommended for TensorFlow >= 2.16 + GPU)

If you are using **Linux** and want GPU support with TensorFlow >= 2.16:

```bash
python3 -m pip install 'tensorflow[and-cuda]'
pip install [other required libraries]
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Native Windows System (Win 10 / Win 11) - (Recommended for TensorFlow <= 2.10 + GPU)

If you want to run it with a GPU on **native Windows**, you should use **TensorFlow <= 2.10**.  
We strongly recommend using **Anaconda** to manage your environment.

#### Step-by-step:

1. **Create a virtual environment**:

    ```bash
    conda create -n {env_name} python=3.10.16
    ```

2. **(Optional) Install Jupyter Notebook**:

    ```bash
    conda install -c conda-forge jupyter
    ```

3. **Install CUDA Toolkit and cuDNN**:

    ```bash
    conda install -c conda-forge cudatoolkit=11.2 cudnn=8.1.0
    ```

4. **Install TensorFlow 2.10.1**:

    ```bash
    python -m pip install "tensorflow<2.11"
    ```

5. **Downgrade NumPy version (required for compatibility)**:

    ```bash
    python -m pip install "numpy<2"
    ```

### ‚úÖ Notes

- The code is based on **TensorFlow >= 2.16**. If you want to run it on GPU, using a **Linux system** is highly recommended.
- If running on **native Windows**, use **TensorFlow <= 2.10**.
